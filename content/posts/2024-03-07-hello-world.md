Checking the commits on the repo I have this project in it's been roughly a year since I started working on this site. Also, checking those commits I can see that there hasn't been much activity throughout the year.

It's not like I didn't expect that. Since I started working as a full-time programmer I've noticed my energy for personal projects has been quite low. That doesn't mean I didn't do anything but work during these 10 months. I've moved, I've switched OS twice (Windows, Arch then NixOS) and I've gotten a lot more proficient in Rust. This year I also took more responsability at work, slowly moving towards managing a small team and writing some company-wide tools/standards, which has given me some topics to write about.

```log
#[info] Yeah there's no use in having a blog if you don't have anything to write about.
```

Huh, who are you?

```log
#[info] Oh don't mind me. And I absolutely do not remind you of a certain bear.
```

Wait a minute you are just a cheap copy of [fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me)'s Cool Bear!

```log
#[info] Well it's only natural, you took inspiration from his blog to create yours.
#[info] And please come up with something better,
#[info] I don't like being stuck on a code snippet.
```

Oh yeah sorry, I'll add it to my todo list.

So yeah, now I have plans for this thing. I feel like I've gone past the frontend design barrier and all that's left is putting the backend together and sprinkling some HTML and CSS on top.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("That's all for now!");
}
```
